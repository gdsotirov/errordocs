HTTP Custom Internationalized Status Messages

About
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache HTTP server allows custom error messages through the ErrorDocument
directive (see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/core.html#errordocument ),
which also could be internationalized using content negotiation (see
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/content-negotiation.html ). For such pages
no advanced CGI is necessary, so using Server Side Includes (see
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html ) provided by mod_include
(see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_include.html ) one could
achieve "homogenous and consistent style and layout" with minimum maintenance
work. This project is based on the ideas and examples from the page Using XSSI
and ErrorDocument to configure customized international server error responses
(see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/misc/custom_errordocs.html ) from HTTPD
1.3's documentation.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are the steps to follow to install and configure custom error docs:

1. Create directory for the error documents (see
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/misc/custom_errordocs.html#createdir ) and
modify your HTTPD configuration as described.
2. Download projects files into the directory created in point 1.
3. Restart HTTPD.
